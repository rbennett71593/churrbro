# Welcome to the ChurroZone


### About the Churrbro

What's up my fellow bros? It's Jared, the Churrbro. I first fell in love with the churro way back in August 2019 while on a trip with my homies and my chick to Disneyland. I was absolutely astounded at the selection of different churros available, and it got me thinking: _"what does it mean to **be** churro?"_
That's what this channel is here to answer. I am committed to traveling the world and seeing how every culture has reimagined and adopted this sweet treat. Be sure to subscibe for churro reviews and churro-related news!

You'll also receive all the benefits from the lower tiers.
